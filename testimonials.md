<h3>2023 Capstone Host Testimonials:</h3>
<br>

“Overall great experience and I highly recommend this experience to others. I would certainly do it again!”

“This was less of a mentorship experience and more of a "co-thinking"/colleague interaction, which was great. The data system is new to our institution, so the student and I were learning and exploring together!”

“The program was very well thought out and I think if anything less might be more in the context of designing a project. There is so much knowledge, skills, and experience that can acquired through a focused capstone project and I think one thing that we did well was scaling back our original project design. “
