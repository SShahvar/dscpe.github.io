#### What is the DSCPE?

The Data Service Continuing Professional Education (DSCPE) fills a much-needed gap in professional development of practicing librarians. 

The objective of this professional education is to train and develop a community of data service librarians. The curriculum is designed as an eight-week online intensive learning experience geared toward preparing working professionals to provide needed data services. The DSCPE course delivery will involve online live sessions, remote self-paced learning, guest speakers, and capstone site mentors.

#### Why create the program?

Currently, research-intensive institutions are focusing on data reproducibility, data reuse, and data integrity. There are many partners and collaborators across institutions participating in this endeavor and librarians play an increasingly important role. The existing workforce needs to be retooled with training and hands-on experience in the area of research data services in order to support their research community.

#### How is the DSCPE program structured?

The DSCPE is composed of three components occuring over eight weeks:
* Program Orientation + Collaboration and Leadership (online live session, 1.5 days)
* Research Data Sharing and Management (remote self-paced learning, 20-25 hours)
* Capstone (70 hours)
  * Matched with data librarians and/or committee of data service
  * Orientation of sites to identify learning components to be covered in capstone projects

#### What is the cost?

The Fall 2022 cohort members' tutition is covered by a gift from Elsevier.
