#### The DSCPE Team is seeking data services librarians or teams to serve as the capstone mentors for the DSCPE students in Fall 2022!
 
A capstone project is a culminating academic and practical experience for DSCPE students. During the capstone period, students are shadowing a data services librarian or team at a partner institution on tasks related to a data project. 

A few examples of a capstone project are: 
* being involved (fully or in part) in data training sessions or workshops
* assisting in identifying federal funding agencies data policies and requirements
* assisting in developing data management plans for grants application
The capstone data project should reflect the needs of the site, and relate to the DSCPE curriculum. It is expected that the capstone projects will vary in size and scope.

The student will be expected to spend a total of **70 hours** shadowing and working with their assigned librarian or team. 

All students are expected to:
* Keep a time log/journal documenting their tasks and experiences
* Summarize their accomplishments and any challenges that they encountered
* Present their reflection and takeaways on their capstone experience

The hosting librarian or team leader will: 
* Serve as a mentor and direct students to perform various activities while treating them as a member of their team
* Communicate with the DSCPE leaders with regard to the progress of their mentees
* Participate in relevant presentations
* Complete pre- and post- capstone evaluations

All host sites will receive a small honorarium.
